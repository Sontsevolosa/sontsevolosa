  <h4> Hi, my little codelovers! </h4>

  I'm Mariia. And yeah, I'm a girl who codes 👩‍💻
  
  When I was 24, I decided to change my life and become a software engineer. After 1 year of self-education at home (sure, it also included tears, despondency, desire to quit everything) I finally got my first job as a developer.
  
  Now sometimes I don't believe that I'm a programmer 🙈
  
  I like my profession so much!
  Also I like to help people make their dreams real through my code. And sure, I like this huge and very warm programmers community 💗
