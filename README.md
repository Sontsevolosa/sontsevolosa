  <h4> Hi, my little codelovers! </h4>

  I'm Mariia. And yeah, I'm a girl who codes 👩‍💻
  
  
  When I was 24, I decided to change my life and become a software engineer. After 1 year of self-education at home (sure, it also included tears, despondency, desire to quit everything) I finally got my first job as a developer.
  
  
  Now sometimes I don't believe that I'm a programmer 🙈
  
  
  I like my profession so much!
  Also I like to help people make their dreams real through my code. And sure, I like this huge and very warm programmers community 💗
  
  
  One of my passions is to share my knowledge with world.
  That's why I like to take part in different programming workshops and meetups: as a mentor, as a speaker or just provide some help. As a volunteer, sure.
  
  
  I'm an active participant in different comunities, such as:

  🗃 [ngGirls](https://twitter.com/angulargirls)

  etc.
